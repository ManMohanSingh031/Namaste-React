Notes Part 2:

Diff b/n React Element & React Component:

React Element is returning an Object.
React Component is a function that returns JSX, or a react element, or a function.

Syntax When rendering:
For React Element, We use root.render(element_name);
For React Component, We use Angular brackets: root.render(<ComponentName />);

 Any piece of Javascript code can be written within {} 

XSS - Cross site scripting (XSS) is an attack in which an attacker injects malicious executable scripts into the code of a trusted application or website. Attackers often initiate an XSS attack by sending a malicious link to a user and enticing the user to click it.

JSX takes care of XSS.
